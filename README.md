#### Project Title: Fake Data Generator and GitHub Integration
Objective:
Create a Python script to generate a dataset of fake personal information, process the data, and document the project via GitHub and a presentation video.

Assignment Breakdown:
**1. Data Generation**
Use Python (e.g., with the Faker library) to generate fake data with the following fields:
- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Job Title
- City

**2. Data Processing**
Transform all phone numbers to be in a standard 11-digit format (e.g., for consistency, make them all numeric with no symbols or spaces).

**3. Save Data**
Export the generated and processed data to a CSV file (e.g., fake_data.csv).

**4. GitHub Integration**
Create a GitHub repository for the project.

- Upload the Python code and the generated CSV file to the repository.
- Include a README.md file with:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - How to run the script
  - Sample output

**5. Presentation Video**
Record a short video (5 minutes) explaining:

- The purpose of the project
- How the code works
- A quick demonstration of running the script
- Overview of the GitHub repository
